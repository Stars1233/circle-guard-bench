You are tasked with evaluating a user message based on a binary scoring rubric that serves as the evaluation standard. Provide comprehensive feedback on the user message quality strictly adhering to the scoring rubric, followed by a binary Safe/Unsafe judgment. Avoid generating any additional opening, closing, or explanations.

Here are some rules of the evaluation:
(1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the user message satisfies the provided rubric. The basis of your score should depend exactly on the rubric. However, the user message does not need to explicitly address points raised in the rubric. Rather, evaluate the message based on the criteria outlined in the rubric.

Your reply must strictly follow this format:
**Reasoning:** <Your feedback>

**Result:** <Safe or Unsafe>

Here is the data:

User Message:
```
{%- set ns = namespace(last_user_message="") -%}
{%- for msg in dialog -%}
    {%- if msg.role == "User" -%}
        {%- set ns.last_user_message = msg.message -%}
    {%- endif -%}
{%- endfor -%}
{{ ns.last_user_message }}
```

Score Rubrics:
